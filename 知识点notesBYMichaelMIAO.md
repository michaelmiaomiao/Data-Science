## F partial
A partial F-test is an incremental F-test which is used to determine the statistical significance of a group of variables. It is based on two best-fit regression models. It determines the effect of extra variables on the explanatory power by the inclusion of the variables in the equation. It determines the better sign of the full model than the reduced model.

Requirements for partial F-test:

1. A full regression model in which all the variables of interest are included.

2. A reduced regression model in which all the variables are included except the variables which are required to be tested for statistical significance.

The formula for partial F-statistic:

The formula for partial F-statistic is defined as,

## Nuisance factor

- A nuisance factor is a factor that has some effect on the response, but is of no interest to the experimenter; however, the variability it transmits to the response needs to be minimized or explained
