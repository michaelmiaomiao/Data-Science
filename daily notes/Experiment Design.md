Question ten. The objective of the following exercise is to have you practice what statistical method you should use for deciding what statistical method to use to find answer to the questions that you will face as a statistical consultant.
A liver transplant surgeon has collected the following data on a random sample of 1000 patients.
1. Liver transplant (was successful, was unsuccessful)
2. Age (<40, 40-39, 50-59, 60-69, >69)
3. Gender
4. Height
5. Donation after cardiac death (yes, no)
6. Weight in pounds
7. Height in centimeters
8. Body mass index (low, medium, high)
9. Level of albumin before liver transplant, one month after transplant, and six months after
transplant.
10. Ethnic background (African American, White, Other)
11. Level of education (high school, two-year college, four-year college, graduate)
12. Alcohol consumption (rarely, sometimes, often)
13. Smoking habit (non-smoker, former smoker, smoker)
14. Diet type (low fat diet, regular diet, high fat diet)
15. Systolic blood pressure (numerical)
16. Diastolic blood pressure (numerical)
17. Hypertension (yes, no) – hypertension means sudden change in blood pressure
18. Diabetic type II (yes – no)
19. Glucose level in the blood (numerical)
20. Health status (excellent, good, poor)
21. High density lipid (HDL or good cholesterol) - numerical
22. Low density lipid (LDL or bad cholesterol) - numerical
23. Total cholesterol - numerical
Statistical methods that you can choose from
1. Two sample test of the mean
2. Chi-square analysis
3. Simple linear regression
4. One-way anova (ANOVA)
5. Factorial anova (anova with more than two factors)
6. Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA)
7. Analysis of covariance (ANCOV A)
8. Repeated measure
9. Mixed design (one within and one between factor)
10. Multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA)
11. Multiple linear regression
12. Logistic regression
13. Multinomial regression
14. Ordinal regression
You can use the following guidelines in deciding what statistical method to use in answering questions that you come across as a statistical consultant
     Statistical Method
      When do we use it?
    Two-sample test of the mean
    Outcome is numerical Predictor is binary
    Chi-square analysis
 Outcome is categorical with two or more levels
Predictor is categorical with two or more level Is used to examine relationship between two categorical variables
     Simple linear regression
      Outcome is numerical
Predictor could be numerical or binary
    One-way ANOVA
 Outcome is numerical
Predictor has two levels or more
Post-hocs allow us to examine the differences between all possible pairs of mean when we reject the null hypothesis.
     Factorial ANOVA (ANOVA with more than two factors)
      Outcome is numerical
It is possible to have two or more categorical predictors with two or more levels
It is possible to examine the interaction or combined effect of the predictors
    One-way multivariate analysis of variance (MANOV A)
 It involves multiple numerical outcome variables
The is one categorical predictor with two or more levels
If null is rejected can use post-hocs for predictors with two or more levels Significant interaction effects are followed with test of simple main effects
     Factorial multivariate analysis of variance (MANOV A)
   It involves multiple numerical outcome variables
The is two or more categorical predictors with two or more levels
If null is rejected can use post-hocs for predictors with two or more levels
             
     Analysis of covariance
   The outcome variable is numerical
Covariate is a numerical variable that is correlated to the outcome. It is possible to use one or multiple covariates
There could be one or more categorical predictors
ANCOVA is similar to performing ANOVA on adjusted scores
An example of a covariate would be examining the effect of a diet program on weight loss while controlling for weight at baseline.
Another example would be examining the effect of teaching French on the knowledge of comprehension while controlling for prior knowledge of vocabulary
     Repeated measures ANOVA
      Multiple measures are made on the same numerical variable for different individuals It is an extension of paired sample test of the mean
They are also referred to as “within subject” designs
An example would be measuring weight or blood pressure multiple times
    Mixed designs or split plot factorial designs
 Mixed designs involve both “between subject” and “within subject” factors.
In the case of “between subject” factors, the subjects can belong to one and one group only. An example of mixed design would be measuring the weight of men and women (gender is the between subject factor) multiple times.
     Multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOV A)
      Multiple numerical outcome variables One or more numerical covariates One or more categorical variables
    Multiple linear regression
 Outcome variable is numerical
Predictors could be categorical or numerical You could examine the interaction of categorical with categorical and categorical with numerical predictors
             
 Logistic regression  Outcome variable is binary (two levels) Predictors could be categorical or numerical You could examine the interaction of categorical with categorical and categorical with numerical outcomes Multinomial regressionOutcome variable is categorical with more than two levels
Predictors could be categorical or numerical You could examine the interaction of categorical with categorical and categorical with numerical outcomes Ordinal regression  Outcome variable is ordinal with more than two levels. An example would be a Likert scale of strongly agree to strongly disagree. Predictors could be categorical, numerical categorical with categorical and categorical with numerical outcomes Using the above guidelines, complete the following table: It would help to: 1) identify the outcome and predictors, 2) determine how they were measured, 3) drawing the design, and 4) identifying the statistical method)
