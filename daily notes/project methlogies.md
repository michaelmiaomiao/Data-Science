### project methodologies

- Test Methodologies include functional and non-functional testing to validate the AUT.
- Each testing methodology has a defined test objective, test strategy, and deliverables.
	- **UNIT Testing** is defined as a type of software testing where individual units/ components of a software are tested. (Unit testing is a WhiteBox testing technique that is usually performed by the developer. )
		  - it fixed bugs early
		  - helps to understan the developers code and make changes
		  - project documentation
		  - code re-use.
  - **Integration Testing** is defined as a type of testing where software modules are integrated logically and tested as a group. Integration Testing focuses on checking data communication amongst these modules. 
  		  - Study the Architecture design of the Application and identify the Critical Modules. These need to be tested on priority.
  		  - Obtain the interface designs from the Architectural team and create test cases to verify all of the interfaces in detail. Interface to database/external hardware/software application must be tested in detail.
	- **System Testing** is the testing of a complete and fully integrated software product. Usually, software is only one element of a larger computer-based system. Ultimately, software is interfaced with other software/hardware systems. System Testing is actually a series of different tests whose sole purpose is *to exercise the full computer-based system*.	
		- Usability Testing 
		- Load Testing
		- Regression Testing
		- Recovery Testing
		- Migration Testing
		- Functional Testing
		- Hardware/Software Testing
		- **White box testing is the testing of the internal workings or code of a software application. In contrast, black box or System Testing is the opposite. System test involves the external workings of the software from the user's perspective.**
	- **Performance Testing** is defined as a type of software testing to ensure software applications will perform well under their expected workload.
		- Features and Functionality supported by a software system is not the only concern. A software application's performance like its response time, reliability, resource usage and scalability do matter. The goal of Performance Testing is not to find bugs but to eliminate performance bottlenecks. 
		- Speed 
		- Scalability 
		- Stability
